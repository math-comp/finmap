## About

Welcome to the Finite maps project website!

This library is an extension of mathematical component in order to
support finite sets and finite maps on choicetypes (rather that finite
types). This includes support for functions with finite support and
multisets. The library also contains a generic order and set libary,
which will be used to subsume notations for finite sets, eventually.

This is an open source project, licensed under the CeCILL-B.

## Get the code

The current stable release of Finite maps can be [downloaded from GitHub](https://github.com/math-comp/finmap/releases).
